Some After Effects utility files & presets I use sometimes

## Presets
- **Crossfade Audio Over Layers.ffx** Linearly fades the audio between a layer followed by a direct overlapped top layer.
- **Fade In-Out Audio (msec).ffx** Linearly fades the audio of a layer.
- **Stretch Frame.ffx** Stretches a padding of pixels to fill the gap of your composition.
