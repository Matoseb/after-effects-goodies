Notes:
	- Styling will be applied based on the [brackets] in the name of the text Animator (see screenshot)
	- You can add unlimited styling rules, but might increase lagginess
	- Bold, Italic are a lil’ cheaty. It won’t change the font family and its weight! It will only transform the characters
	- The text layer must take the sourceText from another source (other text layer for instance)
